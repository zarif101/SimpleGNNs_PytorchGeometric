# A collection of basic graph neural networks implemented using PyTorch Geometric!

- 'citation_network' uses a vanilla GCN for node classification; it uses a popular dataset to categorize scientific papers
- 'mnist_gcn' uses a vanilla GCN for graph classification; uses a dataset of MNIST superpixels, where each image is represented as a graph
- Data is downloaded using PyTorch geometric (see the notebooks)
- Everything is implemented using PyTorch Geometric
- I'll continue to improve documentation and add more notebooks as I have time
- Inspiration and some code is taken from PyTorch Geometric tutorials
